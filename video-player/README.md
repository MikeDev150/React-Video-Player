# Video Player

Currently the player can only play one video. The one imported at the top of `src/App.js`.

In `src/Assets` There is a copyright-free [Music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH5B_C8r9Dk) by [Jonny Easton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHJVYelCXpsV8P4EVWBgj0A) to test out the video player.

Currently all html is in app.js. Later the html will move into separate components.

Also the styling is done with css and some html conditional inline styling. This will instead use styled components later.
